# TTD example

There are three classes in the infra-directory.
Two producer that produce data to a redpanda cluster (I forgot to write their tests ina advance, but will try it after my tests of the stream are green)
And a stream (UserAddressJoin) with some functions

There are some tests that can be found in infra directory located in the test module.
